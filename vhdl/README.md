This directory contains a VHDL simulation model of pacman hardware.

The code was copied from [eshopper](https://github.com/eshopper99/pacman). Similar code also exists at [eniva](https://github.com/eniva/Arcade-Pacman_MiSTer_Enex) and [skiphansen](https://github.com/skiphansen/pano_man). I'm unable to find the code at the original authors site.
